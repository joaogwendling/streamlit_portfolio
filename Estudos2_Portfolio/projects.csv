12;Hospital sectors dashboards;During my time as a Data Analyst and Engineering Trainee at Eficiência Hospitalista Consulting Services, I developed several dashboards in `Looker Studio` with **hospital data** to present the unit's KPIs and monitor them. These dashboards were focused on emergency rooms, ICUs, wards, and Discharge Offices, as shown in the image below. I also designed the **data collection process**, using `Google Sheets` and `Apps Script` to digitize processes that were previously paper-based.;img/ega.png;Dashboard;n;
2;Project management dashboards;Automation of **project management indicators** using `Power BI` connected to `APIs` of tools such as Trello, Asana, and ClickUp. This avoids rework and allows for a more fluid and easier decision-making process.;img/clickup.png;Automation;n;
5;Student funnel dashboard;Dashboard developed for a manager overseeing multiple distance education centers, who needed a better **understanding of problems** and **bottlenecks** in the process of converting candidates into students. Multiple visualizations were created to comprehend the process as a whole, as well as compare different centers, steps in the process and the people responsible for them. ;img/funil.png;Dashboard;n;
10;Financial dashboard and Income Statement automatization;Dashboard built in `Power BI` to provide the financial sector of a coffee industry with information regarding payables, receivables, inventory movements and overall inflows and outflows, using transaction and movement data. With a proper understanding of the business and the correct rules in place, we streamlined the **creation of report**s (such as this, similar to an Income Statement), allowing for more **detailed analysis** at the account and transaction level.;img/dre.png;Dashboard;n;
4;Training Session on Looker Studio for SANE;In March 2023, I conducted a training session on `Looker Studio` for the administrative team at SANE – Society of Anesthesiology. The training covered **theoretical content** on structured data concepts and methods, as well as extensive **hands-on practice** with the software, ranging from its interface to best practices and data visualization tips.;img/treinamento_sane.png;Training;Read more;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7041560606734245888/
11;Spotify’s API (with OAuth2.0);Study on `APIs` and authentication using `Python`. The script searched Spotify’s library for an artist's albums and songs, based on user input and returned a `pandas` DataFrame with the recieved information.;img/spotify.png;Automation;Open notebook;https://nbviewer.org/github/joaogwendling/python/blob/main/SpotifyAPI.ipynb
14;Lyrics Web Scraping;Study on Web Scraping using `Python`, as a continuation of the previous project. Through the use of the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries, the script scrapes songs lyrics from the web and stores them in a `pandas` DataFrame.;img/webscraping.png;Automation;Open notebook;https://nbviewer.org/github/joaogwendling/python/blob/main/Artist%20-%20Spotify%20-%20Lyrics.ipynb
1;Fraud in Health Insurance Exploratory Analysis;Exploration of data  to understand the possibility of fraud in the payments of a health insurance company. A few perspectives were investigated and **statistically tested**, such as reimbursement behaviour, providers that were charging more than others and expenses in initial waiting period. This exploration made it clear that **understanding the business** behind the data is crucial to know where to focus.;img/boxplot.png;Analysis;n;
9;Primary Care Program Statistical Analysis;Analysis conducted to understand the impact of a primary health program in an insurance company. The hypothesis that patients attended by the program would have lower healthcare expenses were investigated through an **exploratory data analysis** and an **A/B test**.;img/trilha.png;Analysis;n;
7;Primary Health Program Before-After Dashboard;A Primary Healthcare Provider wanted a dashboard to monitor the **impact of their program** in their clients’ health expenses. Their main KPI was the variation of the average cost per capita, comparing before and after the patient’s first appointment, but also understanding the cost composition and how different groups of patients responded to the program. An extensive understanding of the business rules was conducted, to create a **data model** that would allow the analyses to be delivered at ease.;img/data_model.png;Dashboard;n;
8;Scheduling process Automation and Digitalization;A anesthesiology society needed to automate and digitalize their schedules, as the existing process was time-consuming, decentralized, and prone to human errors. A solution was developed using Excel `VBA`, creating a **complete environment** for registration and data collection related to the associates’ meetings, vacations, and general appointments,while also **validating for rule violations**.;img/agendamento.png;Automation;n;
3;Simulating Impact of Medication on Health Expenses;Study done for a pharmaceutical company that aimed to use **real-world data** to assess the impact on health expenses of a new medication in the treatment of heart failure. The analysis was based on patient characteristics and expense history, and a simulator was built for the company to understand the impact if certain **parameters** were changed.;img/sim_med.png;Analysis;n;
6;Simulating Impact of new product on a Medical Center;“What would happen to our medical center if we introduced a new insurance product that only covers procedures performed there?” was the question posed by a healthcare company. This question was answered through a **simulator** built in `Power BI`. allowing managers to see how the introduction of the new product would affect the medical center's **current capacity** and the annual costs for patients.;img/sim_center.png;Dashboard;n;
